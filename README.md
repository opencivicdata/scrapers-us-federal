Federal scrapers for the United States
======================================

Currently, the data for the Legislative information is being pulled from
the [United States Project on GitHub](https://github.com/unitedstates/).

Why this repo
=============

This repo is an adaptor to migrate the data into
[Open Civic Data](https://github.com/opencivicdata/) format, so that we can
interoperate the data with other services that consume the format.

This also serves to ensure that we can losslessly convert the data into the
Open Civic Data format, and ensure that the Open Civic Data format maintains
support for Federal level data.
